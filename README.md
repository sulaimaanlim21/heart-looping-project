3d implementation of a 2d active vertex model to capture heart looping wrt single cell behaviour
phd project, created a 3d implementation of a 2d vertex model
Used networkx to store 2 networks, one vertex wise and one cell wise, the model is implemented as done by Osterfield in previous work (including bending term)
The main scripts are force_functions, cell_properties and the simulation runs in sim_stage_new and sim_initialise 
the code is super messy sorry
